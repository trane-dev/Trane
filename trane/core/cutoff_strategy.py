class CutoffStrategy:
    """
    Class that holds a CutoffStrategy. This is a measure to prevent leakage

    Parameters
    ----------
    generate_fn: a function that generates training and test cutoff times.
        input: entity rows
        output: a tuple with the following timestamps:
            (training_cutoff, test_cutoff)

    Returns
    -------

        generate a cutoff dataframe. Takes about 10 sec to load, but then runs
        inNlogN time. (probably. Haven't checked numpy and pandas code. That's
